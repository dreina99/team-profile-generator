# Team Profile Generator
  ## Description  
  This project dynamically generates an HTML file from user input that displays a neatly organized view of a work team. When entering node index.js from the command prompt from the file path where you downloaded the project, a series of prompts will show up on the screen for the user to answer. The HTML file will then be added to the ./dist/index.html file.
